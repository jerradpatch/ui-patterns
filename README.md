2. Typescript :sweet_potato:
changing your file from javascript to typescript
  1. change the file type from .js to .ts
  2. run the gulp file from the cedsci folder "gulp --tomcat h:\cedsci\apachi-tomcat.x.x.x"
  3. fix typescript errors listed in terminal output
  4. all future changes should be made only to the .ts file
